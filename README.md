# Weather Journal App

This small app queries [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)'s API using the key they provide, and returns weather data.

## How to use

Open a terminal window, and paste the following in order:

```
git clone https://github.com/youssef-attai/weather-journal-app.git
cd weather-journal-app
npm install
npm run start
```

Special thanks to the reviewer from Udacity who reviewed my second submition, I had this weird fetch error and they helped me understand the reason behind it and solve it.
