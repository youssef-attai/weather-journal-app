# Weather Journal App Project

## Project description
The main goal of this project is to implement a server-side and client-side app using Node and Express.

Basically, it is a small app that queries OpenWeatherMap's API using the key they provide, and returns weather data.

This can be done in many ways, however, I sticked to the classic method followed by Udacity's course.

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- NodeJs & Express

Special thanks to the Udacity's reviewer who reviewed my second submit, I had this weird "off by one" fetch error and they helped me understand the reason behind it and solve it.
