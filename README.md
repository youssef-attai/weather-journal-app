# Weather Journal App Project

## Project description
The main goal of this project is to implement a server-side and client-side app using Node and Express.

Basically, it is a small app that queries OpenWeatherMap's API using the key they provide, and returns weather data.

This can be done in many ways, however, I sticked to the classic way and followed Udacity's course method, I still have this weird error that I need help resolving, fetching data is "off by one". I know this sounds odd but it is the best way I can describe it, this error makes the first fetch return the default empty object, and all the following fetches return the result of their previous fetch. I have no idea why is this happening, since I'm pretty sure I followed along with the course. Any help with this is truly appreciated.

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
